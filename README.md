# ChatHappy made with React, Golang and MongoDB
ChatHappy is a messaging app that uses "conversations" to group users together so they can chat. Users can have "friends" to save their contacts on the account instead of on the device. The frameworks and databases used in this app are React, Golang/Express, and MongoDB. This is my first project using MongoDB as my database and my second project using React and Golang.
